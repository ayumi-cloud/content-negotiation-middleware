## Motivation

Packages like `middlewares/negotiation` do a very good job to detect the correct
content type based on the `Accept` header (or extension in the URI), however they
delegate to the `RequestHandler` to format the content according to the detected
mime type.

That works fine for most cases but it usually creates a lot of duplication in
complex software, where every single `RequestHandler` should do that formatting
(or depend on some component to do that). That logic should also be added to the
middleware that handles exceptions and converts them to the appropriated HTTP
response.

The goal of this middleware is to provide full content negotiation (detection
and formatting).

## Installation

This package is available on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/lcobucci/content-negotiation-middleware),
and we recommend you to install it using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

```shell
composer require lcobucci/content-negotiation-middleware middlewares/negotiation zendframework/zend-diactoros
```

### Adventure mode

If you're ready for an adventure and don't want to use `middlewares/negotiation`
to handle the detection or `zendframework/zend-diactoros` to create the response
body (`StreamInterface` implementation), don't despair! You'll only have to use
the normal `ContentTypeMiddleware::__construct()` instead of
`ContentTypeMiddleware::fromRecommendedSettings()`.

We do have a small preference for the mentioned packages and didn't want to reinvent
the wheel... but you know, it's a free world.

## Usage

Your very first step is to create the middleware using the correct configuration:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

use Lcobucci\ContentNegotiation\ContentTypeMiddleware;
use Lcobucci\ContentNegotiation\Formatter\Json;
use Lcobucci\ContentNegotiation\Formatter\StringCast;

$middleware = ContentTypeMiddleware::fromRecommendedSettings(
    // First argument is the list of formats you want to support:
    [
        'json' => [
            'extension' => ['json'],
            'mime-type' => ['application/json', 'text/json', 'application/x-json'],
            'charset' => true,
        ],
        'html' => [
            'extension' => ['html', 'htm', 'php'],
            'mime-type' => ['text/html', 'application/xhtml+xml'],
            'charset' => true,
        ],
    ],
    // It's very important to mention that the first format will be
    // used as fallback (no acceptable mime type found), that the
    // order of elements does matter, and that the first element of
    // `mime-type` list will be used as negotiated type.


    // The second argument is the list of formatters that will be used for
    // each mime type:
    [
        'application/json' => new Json(),
        'text/html'        => new StringCast(),
    ]
);
```

Then you must add the middleware to very beginning of your pipeline, which will
depend on the library/framework you're using, but it will be something similar
to this:

```php
<?php

// ...

$application->pipe($middleware);
```

Finally you just need to use `UnformattedResponse` as return of the request
handlers you create to trigger to formatting when needed:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Me\MyApp;

use Fig\Http\Message\StatusCodeInterface;
use Lcobucci\ContentNegotiation\UnformattedResponse;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response;
use Zend\Diactoros\ServerRequest;

final class MyHandler implements ServerRequestInterface
{
    public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        // Does the necessary process and creates `$result` with the unformatted
        // content.

        return new UnformattedResponse(
            (new Response())->withStatus(StatusCodeInterface::STATUS_CREATED),
            $result
        );
    }
}
```

### Formatters

We provide some basic formatters by default: `Json`, `StringCast`, and
`JmsSerializer` (this one requires you to also install `jms/serializer`, sure).

If you want to create a customised formatter the only thing needed is to
implement the `Formatter` interface:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Me\MyApp;

use Lcobucci\ContentNegotiation\Formatter;

final class MyFancyFormatter implements Formatter
{
    public function format($content): string
    {
        // Performs all the magic with $content and creates $result with a
        // `string` containing the formatted data.

        return $result;
    }
}
```
